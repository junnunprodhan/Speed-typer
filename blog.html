        <h3>1.Difference between LocalStorage and sessionStorage </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>sessionStorage maintains a separate storage area for each given origin that's available for the duration of the page session (as long as the browser is open, including page reloads and restores)</li>
            <li>localStorage does the same thing, but persists even when the browser is closed and reopened.</li>
            <li>The only difference is that localStorage has a different expiration time, sessionStorage will only be accessible while and by the window that created it is open.</li>
            <li>That is, the data stored in localStorage persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available for all current and future visits to the site.</li>

        <h3></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Basically, the difference between function scope and block scope is that in a language that uses function scope, any variables declared within a function are visible anywhere within that same function. But with block scope, the visibility of variables is confined to any given block (whether it's an if statement, where/for loop, etc) enclosed by curly braces.</li>
            <li>
                Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for statements, and the like. You can also use them stand-alone with a simple begin-end curly braces {}, not to be confused with empty object literals.
            </li>
            <li>The var keyword behaves differently in function scopes and block scopes. A variable declared with var in a function scope canâ€™t be accessed outside that function scope.</li>
            <li>A variable declared with var in a block scope is available outside of that block scope.</li>
