        <h3>1.Difference between LocalStorage sessionStorage </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>sessionStorage maintains a separate storage area for each given origin that's available for the duration of the page session (as long as the browser is open, including page reloads and restores)</li>
            <li>localStorage does the same thing, but persists even when the browser is closed and reopened.</li>
            <li>The only difference is that localStorage has a different expiration time, sessionStorage will only be accessible while and by the window that created it is open.</li>
            <li>That is, the data stored in localStorage persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available for all current and future visits to the site.</li>
